Virtual Environments - pool
===========================

This is a project I have to do for my "virtual environments" laboratories for university, where we have to use a couple of alternative (as in "alternative to mouse and keyboard") input methods. I intend to create a pool game where you can control the play by using PS Move Motion controller and use steroscopic vision.

Status
------

As of Nov 2011 this is work in progress, but the PS Move Motion Controller communication is working and you can track it using OpenCV/Hough transform.

General Info
------------

Feel free to use this project, this is GPL3. I think you may be interested particularly in the MoveThread class which is a sort-of-wrapper for communicating with the motion controller written for Qt.
